What if your consciousness
Is just a matter of senses
When you're awake you are not,
But in your dreams the other world knocks
What if all those noises we hear
Are the chants of those in our Nightmare trials?
Switch all the lights off
And learn how to watch through

There's something living there you know?
Is something that your mind will blown

A glaze into the gloom
Embracing our Doom
Tear the veil and come through
While the Abyss is looking at you.

In the realm of the obscure
Is your sight so impure
You'll be lost with no endeavor
And your soul will change forever

What if our existence
Is just a specular one?
If you have pretty knee eyes
A universe will open wide
Disconnect yourself from the
Idea that what you can see is here
The Key for the other side
Is inside you, is your inner sight
