Many scripts designed for this intricate world
A countless choice we have, but it doesn't
uphold
It's easy, says the know-it-all
Always not responsible
When it does collapse
They'll pretend not to know
Someone tell me once again
What is right and what is wrong
Gotta choose the only road
What it's going to be Help me see
Playfully, destiny rings the doorbell
I cannot fight or resist Obey them all
Whatever choice that I make I won't succeed
Arriving The edge of the abyss
We cannot redo all the things that have passed
If you wait to choose, it will be in the past
Should you hastily answer though
You'll misjudge the current flow
Decisiveness will not always win for us all
Someone tell me once again
What is right and what is wrong
Gotta choose the only road
What it's going to be Help me see
Playfully, destiny rings the doorbell
I cannot fight or resist Obey them all
Whatever choice that I make I won't succeed
Arriving The edge of...
Can't perceive behind the wall
Can't perceive beyond at all
The ones that try to climb above
The ones who pray it crumbles down
Can't perceive beyond today
The vision starts to slip away and betray
Oh well
Playfully, destiny rings the doorbell
I cannot fight or resist Obey them all
Whatever choice that I make I won't succeed
Arriving The edge of the abyss
