[02:16.01] Razor's edge outlines the dead
[02:18.82] Incisions in my head
[02:21.94] Anticipation, the stimulation
[02:24.89] To kill the exhilaration
[02:36.89] 
[02:28.08] Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
[02:30.37] Step outside yourself and let your mind go
[02:33.85] Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!
[02:57.35] 
[02:39.60] Close your eyes and forget your name
[02:41.93] Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
[02:45.64] As you go insane, go insane!
[02:59.64] 
[03:03.06] Innate seed to watch you bleed
[03:06.29] A demanding physical need
[03:09.28] Desecrated, eviscerated
[03:11.00] Time perpetuated
[03:19.00] 
[03:15.19] Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
[03:17.66] Step outside yourself and let your mind go
[03:21.04] Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!
[03:44.54] 
[03:26.79] Close your eyes and forget your name
[03:29.09] Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
[03:32.73] As you go insane, go insane!
[03:46.73] 
[04:39.80] Inert flesh, a bloody tomb
[04:42.46] A decorated splatter brightens the room
[04:45.19] An execution, a sadist ritual
[04:47.67] Mad intervals of mind residuals
[05:03.17] 
[04:51.10] Close your eyes, look deep in your soul
[04:53.94] Step outside yourself and let your mind go
[04:56.81] Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die!
[05:20.31] 
[05:02.41] Close your eyes and forget your name
[05:04.79] Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain
[05:08.31] As you go insane, go insane!
