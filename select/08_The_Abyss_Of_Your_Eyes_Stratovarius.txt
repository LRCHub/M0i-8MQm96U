I feel like I'm drowning
Trying to catch my breath
Don't know what is happening
There's no sense of time
Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within
Hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you
Can't resist
I don't know why
My life is changing
I cannot recall
Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more
Am I losing my mind
The sun isn't shining
But your eyes light my way
I've found what I've been searching for
My love won't go astray
Deep underneath my skin
Feeling the pain within
Hear my cry
I feel drawn towards you
Can't resist
I don't know why
My life is changing
I cannot recall
Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more
Am I lost
So many years my drifting heart has wandered around
Don't turn on me, won't you stay by my side
Where I've been before
The abyss of your eyes
Meaning so much more
Am I losing my mind
